## Description

Sql-drive-by is a program designed to find multiple websites that are vulnerable to sql injection by running a term through a serch engine and testing its results. Additional features allow the user to search a website for potential admin pages.

## Motivation

This program was created when I was teaching a friend (Shoutout to Jay =P) about website vulnrabilities and was finding it difficult to find an sql injection vulnrable website to show how to test for the vulnerability. I wanted a program that not only made it easier to find these sites but also emphasises how many sites out these are still vulnrable to SQLi and why people should be paying more attention to fixing these issues.
